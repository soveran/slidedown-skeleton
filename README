Slidedown skeleton
==================

This is a small template I use for preparing talks. Feel free to abuse it.

Getting started
---------------

If you don't have pygmentize installed, you can either go for the Python
version (easy_install pygments) or the Ruby wrapper (gem install pygmentize).

Install slidedown:

    $ gem install slidedown

If you have problems installing it, go for my fork:
git@github.com:soveran/slidedown.git

Edit talk.md at will, then run rake to build the slides.

If you note some styles are off, again refer to my patched version.
